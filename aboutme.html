                    <td>My name is Logan Munksgard. I was born in Palm Springs and the career that I want in the future is to be a landscape architect. I have been taking the Engineering Pathway at Palm Desert High School and it has gotten me interested in that field of engineering. My plan to achieve this goal is to get an internship with some friends that I know that run their own company. It is my career choice because it has seemed interesting to me science freshman year.

                    One strength I have that will help me get my career as a landscape architect is that I have had experience creating landscapes for buildings. One characteristic that I have experience with that will help with this career is being adaptable. On one of my architectural projects I had to extend one of the walls on my house and in doing so I had to remove the landscape on the outside of the house. In doing this I learned how to change the landscape to match the house and its surroundings. In my freshman year I experienced how to create a house from scratch on Revit and on Revit you can also create landscaping, this led to me creating my goal of becoming a landscape architect.

                    I have participated in many activities at Palm Desert High School, some being the e-sports club, marching band. From these activities I have learned that I can adapt to the climate around me, for example in marching band it is a very serious activity you have to be very attentive because there could be changes made and you could miss it. And in e-sports I have learned from other players by watching their movements and tactics.
